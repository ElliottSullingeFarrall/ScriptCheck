# Installation

Download **ScriptCheck.zip** from [Releases](https://github.com/ElliottSullingeFarrall/ScriptCheck/releases/latest) and unzip. This will include all the necessary files.

# Usage

To run the script checker use **Python** to execute the `src` module. ScriptCheck will look for several files/folders in the current working directory.

### Solutions

In **solutions.py** create the solution script.

### Questions

In **questions.py** create a dictionary named **questions**. This dictionary should have a key for each question/function name in **solutions.py** and values given by a list of test inputs for that question. The inputs should be in the form of a tuple.

Any modules that need to be imported should also be included in this file.

### Submissions

All submitted scripts (in _.py_ format) should be included in this folder.
